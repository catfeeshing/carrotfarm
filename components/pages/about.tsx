                I'm a somewhat overambitious problem solver and avid hat wearer with a passion for building community and AI/ML, especially foundation and world models, digital twins, and multiagent systems. I also dip my feet in web dev, game dev, and whatever else catches my eye! I like doing a bit of everything.

                Computer science has been my dream major since elementary school, a dream born of a need to create, whether it be through the visual and narrative arts or through programming.
                <br />
                <br />
                I especially love the thought of creating community and connection through technology and harnessing new technologies sustainably and ethically.

                When I'm not being a workaholic, you can find me writing my debut novel drafts (I promise they're coming along), doing digital art (from Minecraft skins to larger pieces), translating Chinese to English for multimedia, reading, exploring the Honkaiverse, and watching donghua! I also really like backseating (aka mentoring GDG on Campus: UC Merced against their will).
